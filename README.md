Dale Metcalfe is a Lecturer of Psychology at Northumbria University. He is a member of the Research and Practice In Developmental Disabilities (RAPIDD) research cluster. Dale’s main interests are around learning disability and autism, with a specific focus on practice based and applied research to improve the quality of life for people with learning disability and autistic people. As an early career researcher, Dale has worked with several charities, organisations, and NHS trusts to facilitate research in these underserved and marginalised populations.
